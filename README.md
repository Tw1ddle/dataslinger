I no longer maintain this project, don't use this!

Demo of [dataslinger-lib](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/dataslinger-lib), a C++ library for conveniently passing data between processes and over a network.

## Usage

 * Use the sendMessages command in the console to send chunks of data between slingers and receivers.
 * In the image-based activities, try drag-dropping images onto the window and observe the transferred images pop up on the receiving end.

## Building

This is a Qt app written in C++. Requires a compiler with C++17 support, depends on boost 1.78.0+ and a recent version of Qt.
